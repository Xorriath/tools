## PoC for CVE-2025-47781
This script automates exploitation of CVE-2025-47781, by grabbing necessary cookies automatically, building the token wordlist, trigger to login attempt, then finally bruteforce the login token with ffuf and print the authenticated cookie.
Requires ffuf program to be installed.

## Example
```
./CVE-2025-47781.py -u http://example.com:80 -e user@example.com
```

If succesful, the script will stop ffuf exectuion and print out the authenticated cookie(next-auth.session-token). Its value can then be copied and replace the unauthenticated next-auth.session-token value to authenticate as the targer user.
In some cases when the value of the generated token is high (ex: 976543) combined with a slow Rallly instance can result in failing to bruteforce the token within the 15 minute limit, but launching the script multiple times would eventually generate a low number token(ex: 234567) and successfully take over the user account even on slow instances of Rallly.
